## Making a Project

### Introduction

So today (1/12/16) I've decided to start coding a simple web game app
using a python back end. This isn't a project to do anything new, but
to practice various standards in the stack and get used to using 
a few coding strategies that are new to me. I have a couple of goals 
for this project:
    
1. I want to document my thought process throughout in az tutorial fashion.

2. This will be a test-driven development process. A test will be written before every piece of code.

3. At every opportunity, I'll use a functional approach to problems.

4. When time is available, code written in python will be translated to javascript, and vice versa.

   
### Tools
    
First, this project will be built as a companion to various treehouse
courses I've taken. I intend to combine several smaller, seperate 
game-oriented projects presented by Kenneth Love in the Python 
courses, enhancing their performance and implementations along the
way.

Once I start on the front-end side of this project, I'll be referring
to various lessons by Andrew Chalkers and Huston Hedinger in the
Javascript courses, as well as lessons by Guil Hernandez in the CSS
courses. As my focus this time is on the back-end, however, these
references may be fewer and farther between.

 
    I'll use doc strings and the unittests library for everything.

    Refer to Python Testing



    I'll be building the back-end using Python with Flask and WTForms, sacrificing real-time updates for routes and form validations.

    Refer to Flask Basics


 
    I'll store all persistant data in a SQL database, making models for every user and game.

    Refer to Using Databases In Python & Build A Social Network W/ Flask



    I'm going to use the character builder, Hack-&-Slash, and Dungeon game exercises we've already built in the Python courses. 

    Refer to Object-Oriented Python, Python Collections, and Flask Basics


### Start
    
Without further ado, I'm going to make a file called tests.py, refer to 
Python Testing, and get started.
