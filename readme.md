## Making a Project

### Introduction

So today (1/12/16) I've decided to start coding a simple web game app
using a python back end. This isn't a project to do anything new, but
to practice various standards in the stack and get used to using 
a few coding strategies that are new to me. I have a couple of goals 
for this project:
    
1. I want to document my thought process throughout in az tutorial fashion.

2. This will be a test-driven development process. A test will be written before every piece of code.

3. At every opportunity, I'll use a functional approach to problems.

4. When time is available, code written in python will be translated to javascript, and vice versa.

   
### Tools
    
First, this project will be built as a companion to various treehouse
courses I've taken. This whole project is designed to go with the lessons
and classes from [Team Treehouse](www.teamtreehouse.com). I intend to 
combine several smaller, seperate game-oriented projects presented by 
Kenneth Love in the Python courses, enhancing their performance and 
implementations along the way.

If you haven't heard of Treehouse and want to follow along, I highly
recommend buying an inexpensive membership, as most of what I'll write
here is glued together with classes from them, and is meant for people
looking how to start their own projects after having taken the courses.

If you live in Multnomah County, you can go to [Code Oregon](www.codeoregon.org)
and sign up for a free membership like I did. But if you're not, I found
the classes so good that I bought a membership for by younger brother
in Michigan anyways, so I recommend highly that you do so. Special thanks
to Kenneth Love for greenlighting this blog, and we'll be careful not to
overlap any code challenges in those classes for students.

Once I start on the front-end side of this project, I'll be referring
to various lessons by Andrew Chalkley and Huston Hedinger in the
[Javascript](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:javascript) courses, as well as lessons by Guil Hernandez in the [CSS](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:css)
courses. As my focus this time is on the back-end, however, these
references may be fewer and farther between.

1. 
 
    I'll use doc strings and the unittests library for everything.

    - Refer to [Python Testing](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/python-testing)


2. 

    I'll be building the back-end using Python with Flask and WTForms, 
    sacrificing real-time updates for routes and form validations.

    - Refer to [Flask Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/flask-basics)


3. 
 
    I'll store all persistant data in a SQL database, making models for 
    every user and game.

    - Refer to [Using Databases In Python](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/using-databases-in-python) & [Build A Social Network W/ Flask](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-social-network-with-flask)


4. 

    I'm going to use the character builder, Hack-&-Slash, and Dungeon game 
    exercises we've already built in the Python courses. 

    - Refer to [Object-Oriented Python](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-python), [Python Collections](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/python-collections), and [Flask Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/flask-basics)
    



### Start
    
Without further ado, I'm going to make a file called tests.py, refer to 
Python Testing, and [get started](https://github.com/nicolasjhampton/python_tutorial_game_project/blob/master/step1.md).
